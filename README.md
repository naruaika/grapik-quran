# Grapik Quran

This proof-of-concept application is specially made for the GNOME desktop. We use [Quran project data](http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/ayat/?l=ar&pg=patches) from King Saud University (KSU) to provide the same experience of reading a non-digital Quran. For all required indexes, we use [Quran metadata](http://tanzil.net) from Tanzil. Here's a prototype of the app:
